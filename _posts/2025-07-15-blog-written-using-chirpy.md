Hey, first post here! I'm still kind of new to blogging so this will be brief, but here's my quick 2 cents on Chirpy, a Jekyll theme:

#### Pros:

- **Predefined themes.** Makes it easier to not focus too much on styling.
- **Markdown support.** Of course. Extremely convenient.
- **Extremely easy.** To deploy to Github Pages.
- **Minimalistic, eye-friendly design.** Looks very modern and minimalistic and has built-in themes support. Minimalism isn't always good honestly but for a blogpage, where you should be solely focused on the content at hand, it works very well.
- **Great docs.** Extremely helpful, check them out.

#### Cons:
- **Difficult to setup.** I set it up a while ago so I'm finding it hard to detail which step I got stuck on, but I encountered a bunch of bugs setting it up compared to just Jekyll.
- **Lots of plugin reliance.** If you're trying to do anything slighlty complex, it gets annoying.
- **Post naming convention sucks.** This might be controversial and I might be exaggerating but I genuinely got the formatting wrong a couple of times, I wish they didn't enforce it and just let us define things inside the markdown.
- **Hard to tweak.** This is what I've heard as I personally didn't tweak it much myself, but requires some SCSS knowledge to tweak it from what I've heard.

Overall, I do recommend it and it looks really nice, genuinely. Setup might be a hurdle but if you can figure it out and you just want a simple blogpage like me, then this can be your go-to.
